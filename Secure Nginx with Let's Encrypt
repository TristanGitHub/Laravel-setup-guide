##Step 1 â€” Installing Certbot
The first step to using Let's Encrypt to obtain an SSL certificate is to install the Certbot software on your server.

Certbot is in very active development, so the Certbot packages provided by Ubuntu tend to be outdated. However, the Certbot developers maintain a Ubuntu software repository with up-to-date versions, so we'll use that repository instead.

First, add the repository.

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot

You'll need to press ENTER to accept. Then, update the package list to pick up the new repository's package information.

    sudo apt-get update

And finally, install Certbot's Nginx package with apt-get.

    sudo apt-get install python-certbot-nginx

Certbot is now ready to use, but in order for it to configure SSL for Nginx, we need to verify some of Nginx's configuration.
