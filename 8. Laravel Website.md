Next, we have to run database migrations, which will populate the newly created database with necessary tables for the demo application to run properly.    
    
    php artisan migrate
    
Artisan will ask to confirm if we intend to run it in production mode. Answer y to the question. It will run necessary database tasks afterwards.

    Artisan output
    **************************************
    *     Application In Production!     *
    **************************************

     Do you really wish to run this command? [y/N] (yes/no) [no]:
     > y

    Migration table created successfully.

We now have Laravel fully installed and configured. Next, we need to configure Nginx to serve the application.

Routing

Laravel provides a quick way to scaffold all of the routes and views you need for authentication using one simple command:

    php artisan make:auth
    
This command should be used on fresh applications and will install a layout view, registration and login views, as well as routes for all authentication end-points. A HomeController will also be generated to handle post-login requests to your application's dashboard.
