## Step 1 Create a new sudo user (Optional)
If you're using a fresh installation of Ubuntu you are proberbaley loggedin as root user. This example creates a new user calledc "Tyrell", but you should replace it with the username you like. You will be asked a few questions, starting with the account password. Enter a strong password and, optionally, fill in any of the additional information if you would like. This is not required and you can just hit ENTER in any field you wish to skip.
    
    adduser tyrell
    
As root, run this command to add your new user to the sudo group (substitute the highlighted word with your new user):
    
    usermod -aG sudo tyrell
    
Now login as you new user.
    
    su - tyrell
 
## Step 2 Create/Add SSH key for secure login
    mkdir ~/.ssh
    chmod 700 ~/.ssh
    nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
