## Step 1 Update and Upgrade
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade -y

## Step 2 Create a new sudo user (Optional)
If you're using a fresh installation of Ubuntu you are proberbaley loggedin as root user. This example creates a new user calledc "Tyrell", but you should replace it with the username you like. You will be asked a few questions, starting with the account password. Enter a strong password and, optionally, fill in any of the additional information if you would like. This is not required and you can just hit ENTER in any field you wish to skip.
    
    adduser tyrell
    
As root, run this command to add your new user to the sudo group (substitute the highlighted word with your new user):
    
    usermod -aG sudo tyrell
    
Now login as you new user.
    
    su - tyrell
 
## Step 3 Create/Add SSH key for secure login
    mkdir ~/.ssh
    chmod 700 ~/.ssh
    nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    
## Step 4 Set Up a Basic Firewall

Different applications can register their profiles with UFW upon installation. These profiles allow UFW to manage these applications by name. OpenSSH, the service allowing us to connect to our server now, has a profile registered with UFW.

You can see this by typing:

    sudo ufw app list

Output:

    Output
    Available applications:
    OpenSSH

We need to make sure that the firewall allows SSH connections so that we can log back in next time. We can allow these connections by typing:

    sudo ufw allow OpenSSH

Afterwards, we can enable the firewall by typing:

    sudo ufw enable

Type "y" and press ENTER to proceed. You can see that SSH connections are still allowed by typing:

    sudo ufw status

    Output
    Status: active

    To                         Action      From
    --                         ------      ----
    OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
    OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)

If you install and configure additional services, you will need to adjust the firewall settings to allow acceptable traffic in. You can learn some common UFW operations in this guide.
