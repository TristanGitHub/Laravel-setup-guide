## Step 1 Installing Certbot
The first step to using Let's Encrypt to obtain an SSL certificate is to install the Certbot software on your server.

First, add the repository.

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot

Now, update the package list to pick up the new repository's package information.

    sudo apt-get update

Install Certbot's Nginx package with apt-get.

    sudo apt-get install python-certbot-nginx

Certbot is now ready to use, but in order for it to configure SSL for Nginx, we need to verify some of Nginx's configuration.

Ubuntu 16.04 servers can use the UFW firewall to make sure only connections to certain services are allowed. We can set up a basic firewall very easily using this application.

Different applications can register their profiles with UFW upon installation. These profiles allow UFW to manage these applications by name. OpenSSH, the service allowing us to connect to our server now, has a profile registered with UFW.

You can see this by typing:

    sudo ufw app list

Output

    Available applications:
    OpenSSH

We need to make sure that the firewall allows SSH connections so that we can log back in next time. We can allow these connections by typing:

    sudo ufw allow OpenSSH

Afterwards, we can enable the firewall by typing:

    sudo ufw enable

Type "y" and press ENTER to proceed. You can see that SSH connections are still allowed by typing:

    sudo ufw status

    Output
    Status: active

    To                         Action      From
    --                         ------      ----
    OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
    OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)

If you install and configure additional services, you will need to adjust the firewall settings to allow acceptable traffic in. You can learn some common UFW operations in this guide.

## Step 2 Allowing HTTPS Through the Firewall

If you have the ufw firewall enabled, as recommended by the prerequisite guides, you'll need to adjust the settings to allow for HTTPS traffic. Luckily, Nginx registers a few profiles with ufw upon installation.

You can see the current setting by typing:

    sudo ufw status

It will probably look like this, meaning that only HTTP traffic is allowed to the web server:

Output
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere                  
Nginx HTTP                 ALLOW       Anywhere                  
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)             
Nginx HTTP (v6)            ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)

To additionally let in HTTPS traffic, we can allow the Nginx Full profile and then delete the redundant Nginx HTTP profile allowance:

    sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
    sudo ufw delete allow 'Nginx HTTP'

Your status should look like this now:

    sudo ufw status

Output
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
Nginx Full                 ALLOW       Anywhere
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
Nginx Full (v6)            ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)

We're now ready to run Certbot and fetch our certificates.
## Step 3 Obtaining an SSL Certificate

The only changes will be:

    Using the Laravel application's location (/var/www/html/quickstart) instead of the default web root (/var/www/html) when requesting an SSL certificate.
    Modifying the /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com configuration file instead of the default server block file.

Specifically, the command to obtain the certificate will be:

    sudo certbot certonly --webroot --webroot-path=/var/www/html/quickstart -d example.com -d www.example.com

And the final version of the /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com configuration file will look like this
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example.com

    server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        server_name example.com www.example.com;
        return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
    }

    server {
        listen 443 ssl http2;
        listen [::]:443 ssl http2;

        include snippets/ssl-example.com.conf;
        include snippets/ssl-params.conf;

        root /var/www/html/quickstart/public;

        index index.php index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        server_name example.com www.example.com;

        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
        }

        location ~ \.php$ {
                include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
                fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock;
        }

        location ~ /\.ht {
                deny all;
        }

        location ~ /.well-known {
                allow all;
        }
    }

Make sure to check that there are no syntax errors in the configuration.

    sudo nginx -t

If all changes were successful, you will get a result that looks like this:

Output
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful

If that is the case, you can safely restart Nginx to put the changes in effect.

    sudo systemctl restart nginx

The Let's Encrypt TLS/SSL certificate will be fully in place and the application will be available through a secure connection. To verify if everything works as expected, simply visit https://example.com. You should see the same application form as before, but this time the connection will be fully secured.

## Step 4 Verifying Certbot Auto-Renewal

Let's Encrypt's certificates are only valid for ninety days. This is to encourage users to automate their certificate renewal process. The certbot package we installed takes care of this for us by running ‘certbot renew’ twice a day via a systemd timer. On non-systemd distributions this functionality is provided by a script placed in /etc/cron.d. This task runs twice a day and will renew any certificate that's within thirty days of expiration.

To test the renewal process, you can do a dry run with certbot:

    sudo certbot renew --dry-run

If you see no errors, you're all set. When necessary, Certbot will renew your certificates and reload Nginx to pick up the changes. If the automated renewal process ever fails, Let’s Encrypt will send a message to the email you specified, warning you when your certificate is about to expire.
